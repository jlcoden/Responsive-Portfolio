                        <p>My name is Joshua Cosson. I'm orginally from a small town in Florida called DeFuniak Springs, not far from Pensacola, Florida. An interesting fact about my hometown is that it is known for having one of the two almost perfectly round circular spring-fed lakes in the world.</p>

                        After completing high schoool, I went to community college in Niceville,FL and then univeristy at FSU in Tallahassee. Go Noles! After university, I worked as an English Assistant in France for about 8 months. I then moved to Seatlle, WA, where my partner and I live today. In Seattle, I work as a Sr. Technical Account Manager for an eSignature Company</p>

                        For fun, I enjoy outdoor activities, including: going on hikes, swimming, and bike riding. I also enjoy reading a good book; some of my favorite genres are Suspense, Fantasy, and Sci-Fi. Lastly, and perhaps most important of all, I love coffee. In particular, iced coffee.
